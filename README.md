# ASP.NET-MVC-Educational
This is an educational web application built using **ASP.NET MVC (.NET Core)**, designed to demonstrate key web development concepts using a full-stack approach.

## Project Overview
- In this project, I implemented full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the following entities:

- Students

- Enrollments

- Courses

- Departments

- User Roles (role management and assignment)

- **I used ASP.NET MVC to build the web application, with a clean layout and responsive design.
Role-based access is implemented â€” admin users can manage departments, courses, students, and enrollments, while regular users can view their personal student details.
The layout supports Dark Mode, Toastr notifications, and a personalized student dashboard via email.
The code sample above shows the layout and dynamic menu rendering based on the user's authentication and role.**
